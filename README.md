# SoSe21-Project-IMOB
Group Repository for SoSe 2021 Project Group IMOB (Influence of medicines on the body)

## Project description
In this project our group attempted to find out how Euthyrox, 
a thryoid drug, influences the physiological function of
the human body by analysing data collected with monitoring 
watches with EKG sensors of cardiological patients. 
We decided to have a 
measurable and attainable goal for the project so initially 
our aim was to build a model making a prediction whether a
patient is under Euthyrox medication or not.

Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain the data of
patients promised at the start of the project.
We had to work with data from only 3 patients, 
which did not allow to make any valuable predictions. 
Facing this problem and too little time to change the 
subject of the project, we decided to build an algorithm 
which could predicts whether a patient is older or younger
than the median age of all patients in the cohort. 

Currently, due to lack of data instances the predictions 
are unreliable. However, when the data is available, 
the script of `main.py` can be tested if it can predict 
the age of the patients from the data provided.
